# Sensor Networks for Healthy Cities 🌆🌍

## Overview 📝

In collaboration with the Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK) NGO, we initiated a project to deploy environmental and seismic sensors in Prishtina, Prizren, and Tirana. Utilizing open-source hardware and software, our goal is to collect and openly share data on air quality and seismic activity, fostering community awareness and engagement in environmental monitoring.

## Objectives 🎯

- **Data Collection**: Gather real-time environmental data, including air pollutants and seismic activity, to assess and compare the health of the participating cities.
- **Public Engagement**: Provide open access to the collected data, encouraging citizens and researchers to explore and analyze the information.
- **Community Awareness**: Raise awareness about environmental and seismic phenomena that may impact local communities.
- **Citizen Science Empowerment**: Enable residents to actively participate in scientific research through accessible technology.

## Importance of Open Source Technology in Citizen Science 🛠️

Open-source technology plays a pivotal role in democratizing scientific research and environmental monitoring. By leveraging open-source tools, we:

- **Enhance Collaboration**: Open-source platforms encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing experts and enthusiasts from various fields to contribute to complex challenges.

- **Accelerate Innovation**: Open-source fosters an environment that accelerates innovation by minimizing barriers to entry and enabling rapid experimentation.

- **Democratize Access to Knowledge**: Open access to research findings and data empowers individuals, educators, and policymakers, especially in regions where access to scientific journals may be limited.

- **Improve Reproducibility**: Transparency in open-source projects allows for increased reproducibility of research, ensuring results can be independently verified.

- **Increase Public Engagement**: Open-source science encourages public participation, enabling citizen scientists to contribute to data collection and analysis, thereby enhancing the diversity of perspectives in research.

By adopting open-source technologies, our project empowers communities to engage directly with environmental data, fostering a collaborative approach to addressing urban health challenges.

## Deployed Sensor Modules 🛜

### Smart Citizen Kit 🌡️

The [Smart Citizen Kit](https://smartcitizen.me/) is an open-source environmental monitoring platform that measures various parameters, including:

- Air temperature 🌡️
- Humidity 💧
- Noise levels 🔊
- Light intensity 💡
- Air pressure 🌬️
- UV radiation ☀️
- Air quality (PM, NOx, VOCs) 🏭

These sensors provide wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi, enabling real-time data transmission to the Smart Citizen platform. The modular design allows for customization and expansion based on specific monitoring needs.

### Raspberry Shake 🌍

The [Raspberry Shake](https://raspberryshake.org/) is a professional-grade seismograph that detects ground movements and seismic activity. Built around the Raspberry Pi, it offers:

- High-precision vertical seismograph capabilities 📈
- Detection of both natural and human-induced seismic events 🌐
- Real-time data visualization and global earthquake tracking 📊
- User-friendly design suitable for both professionals and enthusiasts 👩‍🔬👨‍🔬

By capturing detailed ground motion data, Raspberry Shake contributes valuable information to our understanding of seismic activities in the region.

## Data Accessibility 📂

All collected data is openly accessible to the public through the respective platforms:

- **Environmental Data**: Available on the [Smart Citizen platform](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/), where users can explore real-time measurements and historical trends.
- **Seismic Data**: Accessible via the [Raspberry Shake Station View](https://stationview.raspberryshake.org/), offering insights into local and global seismic activities.

## Community Involvement 🌱

We encourage citizen scientists, researchers, and community members to engage with the data, participate in discussions, and contribute to raising awareness about environmental and seismic issues. By leveraging open-source technology, this project aims to empower individuals and communities to take informed actions toward a healthier and more resilient environment.
