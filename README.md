# Sensor Networks for Healthy Cities

## Overview

In collaboration with the Free Libre Open Source Software Kosova (FLOSSK) NGO, we initiated a project to deploy environmental and seismic sensors in Prishtina, Prizren, and Tirana. Utilizing open-source hardware and software, our goal is to collect and openly share data on air quality and seismic activity, fostering community awareness and engagement in environmental monitoring.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather real-time environmental data, including air pollutants and seismic activity, to assess and compare the health of the participating cities.
- **Public Engagement**: Provide open access to the collected data, encouraging citizens and researchers to explore and analyze the information.
- **Community Awareness**: Raise awareness about environmental and seismic phenomena that may impact local communities.
- **Citizen Science Empowerment**: Enable residents to actively participate in scientific research through accessible technology.

## Importance of Open Source Technology in Citizen Science

Open-source technology plays a pivotal role in democratizing scientific research and environmental monitoring. By leveraging open-source tools, we:

- **Enhance Collaboration**: Open-source platforms encourage interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing experts and enthusiasts from various fields to contribute to complex challenges. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- **Accelerate Innovation**: Open-source fosters an environment that accelerates innovation by minimizing barriers to entry and enabling rapid experimentation. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Democratize Access to Knowledge**: Open access to research findings and data empowers individuals, educators, and policymakers, especially in regions where access to scientific journals may be limited. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Improve Reproducibility**: Transparency in open-source projects allows for increased reproducibility of research, ensuring results can be independently verified. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

- **Increase Public Engagement**: Open-source science encourages public participation, enabling citizen scientists to contribute to data collection and analysis, thereby enhancing the diversity of perspectives in research. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

By adopting open-source technologies, our project empowers communities to engage directly with environmental data, fostering a collaborative approach to addressing urban health challenges.

## Partner Organizations

- **Prishtina**: [Prishtina Hackerspace](https://prishtinahackerspace.org/)

## Deployed Sensor Modules

### Smart Citizen Kit

The [Smart Citizen Kit](https://smartcitizen.me/) is an open-source environmental monitoring platform that measures various parameters, including:

- Air temperature
- Humidity
- Noise levels
- Light intensity
- Air pressure
- UV radiation
- Air quality (PM, NOx, VOCs)

These sensors provide wireless connectivity via Wi-Fi, enabling real-time data transmission to the Smart Citizen platform. The modular design allows for customization and expansion based on specific monitoring needs.

### Raspberry Shake

The [Raspberry Shake](https://raspberryshake.org/) is a professional-grade seismograph that detects ground movements and seismic activity. Built around the Raspberry Pi, it offers:

- High-precision vertical seismograph capabilities
- Detection of both natural and human-induced seismic events
- Real-time data visualization and global earthquake tracking
- User-friendly design suitable for both professionals and enthusiasts

By capturing detailed ground motion data, Raspberry Shake contributes valuable information to our understanding of seismic activities in the region.

## Data Accessibility

All collected data is openly accessible to the public through the respective platforms:

- **Environmental Data**: Available on the [Smart Citizen platform](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/), where users can explore real-time measurements and historical trends.
- **Seismic Data**: Accessible via the [Raspberry Shake Station View](https://stationview.raspberryshake.org/), offering insights into local and global seismic activities.

## Community Involvement

We encourage citizen scientists, researchers, and community members to engage with the data, participate in discussions, and contribute to raising awareness about environmental and seismic issues. By leveraging open-source technology, this project aims to empower individuals and communities to take informed actions toward a healthier and more resilient environment.
